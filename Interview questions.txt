What are closures?
 https://github.com/tarun-nagpal-github/js-practice-programs/blob/master/closure.js

At first glance, a closure is simply a function defined within another function. 
However, the power of closures is derived from the fact that the inner function remembers the environment in which it was created. 
In other words, the inner function has access to the outer function’s variables and parameters.

Benefits of Closures ?

1. Function factories
2. Namespacing private functions


What are design patterns in JavaScript?

Design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.
Another way of looking at patterns are as templates for how we solve problems - ones which can be used in quite a few different situations.

Design patterns have three main benefits:

1. Patterns are proven solutions: They provide solid approaches to solving issues in software development using proven techniques that reflect the experience and insights the developers that helped define them bring to the pattern.

2. Patterns can be easily reused: A pattern usually reflects an out of the box solution that can be adapted to suit our own needs. This feature makes them quite robust.

3. Patterns can be expressive: When we look at a pattern there’s generally a set structure and vocabulary to the solution presented that can help express rather large solutions quite elegantly.

What are various design pattrens in JS ?

1. Module Design Pattern - JavaScript modules are the most prevalently used design patterns for keeping particular pieces of code independent of other components.
Modules are JavaScript "classes".

2. Prototype Design Pattern - The Prototype design pattern relies on the JavaScript prototypical inheritance. The objects created are clones (shallow clones) of the original object that are passed around. 

3. Singleton - 	A class of which only a single instance can exist.

4. Observer 
	Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

What is the diffrence between Undefined vs NULL?

Undefined means the variable has been declared but its value is not defined.
null is an assigned value that have no value at all.

Unassigned variables are initialized by JavaScript with a default value of undefined. 
JavaScript never sets a value to null. That must be done programmatically.
